## no need to install ; without dependency
animate svg with layers:

1. Create a Layered SVG in Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, etc.
2. Copy your SVG code.
3. Open "animate.svg.layers.exe" (https://github.com/aad1416/animate-svg-with-layers/releases). 
* Notice: if you have Python3 in your computer, you can run "animate svg layers.pyw" too.
5. Your animated SVG code is ready, just like that! also code is minified, so copy it and paste in your HTML or in your SVG file.

# how it works?

It only adds to your SVG code a few scripts and css phrases that are less than 500 characters.
Scripts change the Opacity of layers,then the animation is done via the GPU instead of CPU.
