**make SVG animation with layers:**

1. Create a Layered SVG in Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator, etc.

2. launch "animate.svg.layers.exe" (https://github.com/aad1416/animate-svg-with-layers/releases). 
      * Notice: if you have Python3 on your computer, you can run Source Code too.

3. If you copied the SVG code, the program fetch it from clipboard automatically. Else open your SVG file.

4. Click on "animate". Your animated SVG code is ready, just like that! also code is minified.

# how it works?

It only adds to your SVG code a few scripts and css phrases that are less than 500 characters.
Scripts change the Opacity of layers,then the animation is done via the GPU instead of CPU.
